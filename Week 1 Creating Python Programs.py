# Create a Python Programs
# Part 1: 
# Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers
# User to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, add them together to find the output. Also, subtract the two numbers to find the output.

# Read two integers from user input
num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Perform and print the calculations
print(num1 + num2)  # Addition
print(num1 - num2)  # Subtraction

# Part 2:
# Find the multiplication and division of two numbers.

# User to input two numbers (num3 and num4). 
# multiply and divide num1/num2 to find the output.

# Read two integers from user input
num3 = int(input("Enter the Third integer: "))
num4 = int(input("Enter the fourth integer: "))

# Perform and print the calculations
print(num3 * num4)  # Multiplication
print(num3 / num4)  # Division
